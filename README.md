# MacOS Battery Tracker

## Overview

MacOS Battery Tracker is an automated tool designed to monitor and analyze the health of your MacBook's battery over
time. By tracking key metrics such as cycle count and maximum capacity, this application provides valuable insights into
your battery's performance and degradation patterns.

## Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Regularly captures battery cycle count and maximum capacity.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores collected data in a CSV file for long-term tracking.
- **Visual Analytics**: Generates time-series plots to visualize battery health trends.
- **Effortless Monitoring**: Eliminates the need for manual checks through system reports.

## Example Output

Below are sample visualizations generated by the MacOS Battery Tracker:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CedricDeVijt/MacOS_Battery_Tracker.git
   cd MacOS_Battery_Tracker
   ```

2. Set execution permissions for the script:
   ```
   chmod +x battery_tracker.sh
   ```

## Usage

Run the script manually:

```
./battery_tracker.sh
```

## Automation

### Option 1: Using the Automation Script

1. Make the automation script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x automate.sh
   ```

2. Run the automation script:
   ```
   ./automate.sh
   ```

This will set up a cron job to run the battery tracker every Monday at 12:00 PM.

### Option 2: Manual Cron Job Setup

1. Open your crontab file:
   ```
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line (adjust the path as necessary):
   ```
   0 12 * * 1 /path/to/battery_tracker.sh
   ```

3. Save and exit the crontab editor.

## Configuration

You can modify the cron job schedule by editing the `automate.sh` file or by manually adjusting the crontab entry. Refer
to [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) for assistance with cron job syntax.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib

Dependencies are automatically installed in a virtual environment when running the `battery_tracker.sh` script.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with cron job execution, check the system logs:

```
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```
